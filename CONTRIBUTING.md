Project and community
More than ten years ago, ROS started with Ubuntu. Our responsibility and commitment to this community will keep growing. 
Canonical's robotics team is your team. We value your input and contributions!

You can get involved by:

+ Reporting bugs: we want to know about the problems so we can fix them.
+ Quality assurance: before releasing new features we make a “Call for Testing” a week prior to each update reaching “stable”. This is your opportunity to discover and report any problems.
+ Documentation: there are lots of ways to use Snaps and Ubuntu Core for robotics applications. We try to describe the important ones, but maybe we missed yours.
+ Feature requests: we have a lot of ideas on what to do next but you know what you need.
+ Code changes: the code is open and we are open to accepting changes to it. So, don’t worry about maintaining a new fork, and instead, let’s work together.

Robotics in Ubuntu will continue growing with our community. If you want to get involved:

+ Join the [Discourse community forum](https://forum.snapcraft.io/)
+ Read our [Code of Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/code-of-conduct?_ga=2.257795469.700127210.1669067579-38830517.1655463002)
